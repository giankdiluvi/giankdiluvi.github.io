## About


I am a PhD student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/)
at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) (UBC),
where I also completed my MSc.
My supervisors are [Trevor Campbell](https://trevorcampbell.me/)
and [Ben Bloem-Reddy](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~benbr/).
I did my BSc in Applied Mathematics at [ITAM](https://www.itam.mx/en)
under the supervision of
[Ernesto Barrios](https://faculty.itam.mx/facultad/102320-ernesto-juvenal-barrios-zamudio).

Before coming to UBC, I worked at [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/)
and also in the quick counts' committee of Mexico's 2018 general election.

In my free time, I enjoy road biking around Vancouver,
reading sci-fi and fantasy novels,
and cooking fresh pasta.


## Research interests

I am mostly interested in developing algorithms for Bayesian inference
with theoretical guarantees that allow us to solve large-scale problems.
