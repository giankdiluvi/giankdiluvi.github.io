# Things to do in Vancouver

Vancouver is a beautiful city! 


## Food

**Ramen**
The ramen scene in Vancouver is insanely good.
You will probably not go wrong no matter where you go,
but here are some options that I have tried and liked:
- Maruhachi. They have a chicken broth; probably my goto ramen around. 
Their veggie curry broth is good too.
- Santouka Excelent pork broth, but their veggie option is not as good as Maruhachi.
- Tonkotsu. Also another great option.
- Kintaro. Good ramen but more than anything *big* portions.
- Danbo. Allegedly the best one in Vancouver, but in my experience it's just... good. 
There's almost always a line too, which in my opinion is not worth it.
- Kinton at UBC. Surprisingly good ramen given that it's on campus 
(but noticeably worse than all the above.)
