<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>On July 1, 2018, over 3000 government representatives were elected at the polls
in one of the biggest general elections in Mexican history.
The Mexican electoral authority (INE in Spanish) organized a system of
quick counts to predict the results from some of these elections—
namely, the Presidential election and nine governorship elections.
For this purpose, nine academic statisticians were invited to form
the so-called quick counts committee.</p>

<p>A quick count is a statistical method to estimate the results of an election,
usually the day it takes place.
However, unlike an exit poll—
where data is obtained by asking people for which candidate they voted—
a quick count is based on information reported directly from polling station officers,
thereby making the data more reliable.</p>

<p>I worked with committee member
<a href="https://facultad.itam.mx/en/facultad/15063-manuel-mendoza-ramirez">Dr. Manuel Mendoza</a>
as his research assistant for this project, along with Gerardo Orantes.
We were in charge of devising the sampling design for the state of Chiapas,
as well as for estimating the results for the governorship elections in
Chiapas, Guanajuato, and Morelos,
and for estimating the Presidential election results
(which was done by combining the results from multiple models, ours included).</p>

<p>The 2018 quick counts were a success, as the results from all elections—
and specifically the Presidential election—were correctly estimated.
Multiple reports, presentations, and other content were derived from this project,
and I created this page to compile the ones in which
Manuel, Gerardo, and I worked on.</p>
