<p>Vancouver is a beautiful city!</p>

<h2 id="the-outdoors">The outdoors</h2>

<p><strong>Ramen</strong>.
The ramen scene in Vancouver is insanely good,
and usually cheaper than other cuisines.
You will probably not go wrong no matter where you go,
but here are some options that I have tried and liked:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maruhachi. They have a chicken broth; probably my goto ramen around. 
Their veggie curry broth is good too.</li>
  <li>Santouka Excelent pork broth, but their veggie option is not as good as Maruhachi.</li>
  <li>Tonkotsu. Also another great option, but lacking in veggie options.</li>
  <li>Kintaro. Good ramen but more than anything <em>big</em> portions.</li>
  <li>Danbo. Allegedly the best one in Vancouver, but in my experience it’s just… good. 
There’s almost always a line too, which in my opinion is not worth it.</li>
  <li>Kinton at UBC. Surprisingly good ramen given that it’s on campus 
(but noticeably worse than all the above.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sushi</strong>.
Sushi in Vancouver is incredibly good, 
and often the best bang for your buck cuisine around.
My goto places:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Osaka. Their mix roll combo is huge and really good. Tons of good veggie options.</li>
  <li>Big bang. Probably one of my favorites around, 
although the veggie options are not that great.</li>
  <li>Tom sushi. Considered by many one of the best in town. 
I think it’s great but doesn’t necesarilly stand out.</li>
  <li>Yummy to go. Cheap and quick. 
Not the best around but it’s still very good and close to my place so I go there a lot.</li>
  <li>Koi. The best sushi close to UBC. It is <em>very</em> cheap and quite decent.
You get 10% off if you pay cash, too.</li>
  <li>Ahi. Good option if you’re in Kits.</li>
  <li>Ton Ton. Good for bento boxes and combos like that. 
Close to Queen Elizabeth Park if you’re in that area.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Brunch</strong>.
Many good options around,
but also many overhyped places.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Red Umbrella. The best one around in my opinion.
Their bennies are superb, but so is everything else.</li>
  <li>Craffles. Probably my goto place. The owners are Brazilian
and so the recipes have a nice twist.
I like their tapioca crepes and their bennies 
(which come on top of a waffle instead of an English muffin).
Their milkshakes are insane if that’s your kind of thing.</li>
  <li>Jam Cafe and Fable. The two most popular options in Vancouver and,
in my opinion, <em>very</em> overrated.
Jam always has a line and their bennies are just… not great?
Their sweet stuff servings are huge, though—pancakes the size of a cake.
Fable is also very popular but I think it’s just… okay.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mexican</strong>.
Listen. If you want the real Mexican experience,
you probably won’t get it in Vancouver.
But that doesn’t mean there aren’t great places.
But beware: for every good place there seem to be many bad ones.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Machete. My favorite around. Their signature dish is huge and tastes like… home.</li>
  <li>Tamaly. Highly recommend their brunch, which has many classic Mexican dishes.</li>
  <li>Lucha Libre. Good tacos—I particularly enjoyed their suadero.</li>
  <li>Toloache. Also a good option. Their tortilla soup is great.</li>
  <li>Margaritas. Surprisingly good.</li>
  <li>Avoid: La Taquería,</li>
</ul>
